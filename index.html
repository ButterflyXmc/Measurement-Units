    <h2>SPRING</h2>
    <p> The season of spring marks the emergence of flowers and the breeding of animals. 
        The chirping of the birds in the early mornings and the buzzing of the bees in the night become very 
        soothing and calm after a long winter's silence.There's stronger sunlight, temperature beigns to rise, and the days grow
        longer. 
    </p>

    <h2>SUMMER</h2>
    <p>Summer season is the hottest season of the year. In this season the temperature became so high that water 
        starts to evaporate very quickly. But this is the most entertaining season for kids who enjoy it to the fullest 
        because their school gets off in the summer season.

    <h2>Fall</h2>
    <p>The season when the days get shorter and the temperatuer 
        start to drop. Fall is the season for all senses. The feel of cooler temperatures after a long summer. 
        A warm, visually pleasing palate of reds, oranges and browns. The taste of pumpkin spice in everything. 
        The sound of crunching leaves underfoot. The smell of woodsmoke.

    <h2>WINTER</h2>
    <p>Winter, the coldest season of the year, comes between autumn and spring. It is associated with plunging 
        temperatures and icy weather, but its impact and timing change according to location. The farther an area 
        lies from the equator, the colder temperatures it experiences. </p>
